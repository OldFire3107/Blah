# Blah! - My School Project

Note: This is created in an ancient compiler called Turbo C++ version 3.2. So this code's encoding may not be read by today's IDE's and so may not be able to compile it but only View it. You are free to add changes by adding a branch. If you are opening the code in a mordern IDE like CLion or Visual Studio to see better the best encoding to load it in is the 8-bit IBM437 encoding which loads 96% of the characcters correctly. 

Contains the following files:
Blah!V2.cpp
*I will soon add the additional files that where used to make this up.
